# DataBase-Management-Project
A Student Database Management System built using Python, MySQL, and Streamlit. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete student records through an interactive web interface. The project demonstrates CRUD operations, database integration, and a clean UI for managing academic data.

Project Development Process
The development of the Student Database Management System was carried out in the following structured steps:

1. Requirement Analysis
Defined the core functionality: student record creation, reading, updating, and deletion.

Chose Python for backend logic, MySQL Server for the database, and Streamlit for building a lightweight, interactive UI.

2. Database Design
Designed the database schema for storing student details.

Created a table in MySQL with fields like ID, Name, Age, and Grade.

Set up MySQL Server and connected it with Python using mysql-connector-python.

3. Backend Development
Established database connection through Python.

Implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using SQL queries.

Handled data insertion, retrieval, update, and deletion programmatically.

4. Frontend Development with Streamlit
Built a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit.

Created separate sections for Add, View, Update, and Delete operations.

Displayed data in a clean, tabular format using st.table() and st.dataframe().

5. Testing and Debugging
Tested each operation individually to ensure proper database interaction.

Handled common errors such as empty inputs, duplicate entries, and connection issues.

6. Documentation
Wrote detailed project documentation including README, code comments, and schema explanation.

Described how to set up and run the project locally.

7. Deployment (Optional)
The project can be deployed using platforms like Streamlit Cloud, Render, or Heroku for public access.
